- 👋 Hi, I’m Issac!
- 👀 I have a fair amount of interests. Hiking, drawing, coding, sports... The list goes on and on. I consider myself something of a jack-of-all-trades, or at least I   try to be. I find that it's really fun learning new skills and continuing to improve on them. Although I may have a fair amount of interests, my goal has remained     the same: to learn and to enjoy learning.
- 🌱 I'm currently majroing in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics at Metropolitan State University of Denver. I have experience in Java, JavaScript, Python, and SQL, including libraries and frameoworks like Spring and React. Currently, I have interests in backend development, computer vision, and information technology.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects were help is needed within my set of skills! And beyond of course!
- 📫 You can reach me at lopezissaca@gmail.com
