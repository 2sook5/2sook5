- 👋 Hi, I’m Issac!
- 👀 I have a fair amount of interests. Hiking, drawing, coding, sports... The list goes on and on. I consider myself something of a jack-of-all-trades, or at least I   try to be. I find that it's really fun learning new skills and continuing to improve on them. Although I may have a fair amount of interests, my goal has remained     the same: to learn and to enjoy learning.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning Computer Science and Mathematics at Metropolitan State University of Denver. I have experience in Java, JavaScript, Python, and MAL,         including libraries like Processing and p5.js. I also have experience with GIMP, AWS Cloud, and Git. Can't forget HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to learn more about web     development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects were help is needed within my set of skills! And beyond of course!
